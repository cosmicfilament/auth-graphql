# auth-graphql
graphql

Great Udemy course on setting up passport auth using mongod db and graphql.
I redid the project as I went along in the course and used functional components and hooks instead of class components on the react side of things.

Also, I split the client and server packages up and also made everything work with the latest react, apollo, node and express modules.

Good times.
